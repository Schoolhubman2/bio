					<h3>About Pink Floyd</h3>
					<h4>Pink Floyd is a Space Rock-Progressive Rock-Art Rock band formed in London. Their Debut Album, the Piper at The Gates of Dawn, struck their first gold, which was a great achievement for their first album. However, Ummagumma earned the band's first platinum. Once they blasted off to The Dark Side of The Moon, they have reached the peak of their fame. They didn't just specialize in progressive rock or Psychedelic rock, but they specialized in songs that were the result of their trials and tribulations they have encountered, which stole everyone's hearts.</h4>

					<h3>Why their rock rocks through with Soaring Colors!</h3>
					<p>There is actually a certain magic that exists within the music. Nearly all of Pink Floyd's albums are based upon a storyline, so they all tell a special story of their own. The Lyrics of many of Pink Floyd's songs included Philosophical messages centered around their album theme, such as Anti-War messages in the album The Final Cut, for instance. Many of the song lyrics also can be said to tell a certain story. Similarly to how Shakespeare wrote some of his greatest tragedies, the Financial and emotional ups, downs, and struggles in the life of the band actually were some of the best inspirations for their songs, consequently resulting in the lyrics being written as such.<br>
						<br>
					Their songs touch the hearts of fans to this day, and the Band has saw this as a great recipe for their finest works. This has continued until The Endless River was released, which was the result of the final moments of Pink Floyd before the band split up, which was most likely the result of the death of Wright, and to a certain extent, Barrett.</p>

					<p>Roger Waters and Nick Mason met each other when they studied architecture together in London. Once they quickly became close friends, they decided to play music together. Keith Noble, his sister, Clive Metcalfe, and later, Richard Wright formed a band involving the two friends, and the group created their very own music group-The Sigma 6. They performed songs composed by others, notably a band called the Searchers. <br>
						<br>
					Soon after, Syd Barrett was welcomed into the band, and the name eventually was changed into the Tea Set. The band of friends would soon head to underground music. Noble, Metcalfe, and the rest of the group went their ways, and the band started getting newcomers in, as well as people going out. The Faithful quartet consisting of Wright, Barrett, Waters, and Mason stayed together when Barrett finally coined the band to be named "Pink Floyd". The name comes from Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, two famous blues musicians.<br>
						<br>
					Although band started off well with its debut album, Barrett's mental condition grew unstable, as he seemed unresponsive and depressed, resulting in his replacement by David Gilmour. The main band members have grouped together for reunions several times, and the remaining musicians still may get together from time to time.</p>
